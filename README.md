# Practice with the GOF Design Patterns

Sample code for a C# Design Patterns course I took on Pluralsight that targets .NET 8. It uses the classic 23 design patterns made famous in 1994 and demonstrates how they can be applied in a modern language like C#. Rather than being a comprehensive project, this repository contains examples to use as a reference.

The project contains folders for each pattern. I followed along in the starter files to pratice with the patterns and learn them more in-depth, so you'll notice they essentially just became the finished files. There are some additional notes from my experience and from taking a design patterns class at BYU.
